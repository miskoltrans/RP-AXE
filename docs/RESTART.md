# RP-AXE — Restart Backlog

Landing pad for the tree-first rebuild (see [`../VISION.md`](../VISION.md)) until the full
roadmap is written.

**Keep & refine:** contracts (port-and-strip); avionics (rename → RP-1 names + rebalance);
deploy/rebuild tooling (improve).
**Rebuild from scratch:** tech tree; part baseline + placement; economy.

## Decisions settled (this session)
- **Mod parts** — curate a canonical part **manifest** (single source of truth); uncurated /
  3rd-party parts fall to a **standalone Experimental side-node** (visible, low science, *off*
  the main tree, excluded from balance). Player flexibility via a later `allowUncurated` toggle.
- **Part boundary** — **RO-config floor + author our own configs** to fill sparse late-tree paths
  (Nertea/Orion/probes). Strict-RO is the start state; config-authoring is the deliberate value-add.
- **Probe/capsule cross-branch "prerequisite-tech checklist"** — **post-MVP** plugin layer.
- **Parts mix** — procedural is the workhorse; layer in **curated iconic historical/stockish** parts
  where they teach a design or carry an aha-moment (key probes, iconic capsules/engines), cut filler
  variants. Education pillar earns its place without bloat. Sets the manifest's composition.

## Roadmap (critical path)
Each phase gates the next; avionics + contracts ride alongside, off the critical path.

- **P0 — Part list** *(= T1 below, unblocked, START HERE)*. Lock the canonical manifest.
  **Prove:** committed manifest, every part RO-supported or has an authored config.
- **P1 — Tree architecture.** Branch taxonomy (engineering disciplines, real names); node schema
  (id / tier / deps / `anyToUnlock` / flavor text); editor + build pipeline (lean on ETT).
  **Prove:** a documented branch map + schema; tooling renders a stub tree.
- **P2 — Tree skeleton (parity).** Place the whole manifest so every part has a home (~200 nodes),
  tiered node costs; convergence gates + multi-entry paths; Experimental side-node catches the rest.
  **Prove:** 0 orphans (bar Experimental); loads + renders; AutoTest passes.
- **P3 — Economy rework.** Science = primary gate; part entryCost = R&D; launch cost = ops; no time
  pressure; **drop RP-1 reliability/run-data grind.** **Prove:** play session / solvency audit shows
  the gates bite as intended.
- **P4 — Avionics** *(parallel)*. Rename to RP-1 terms; rebalance. **Prove:** flyable early control.
- **P5 — Special parts** *(post-MVP)*. Probe subtree (hire-JPL / hire-OKB) + capsule capability-split
  + cross-branch prerequisite-tech checklist plugin. **Prove:** a probe gated by multi-branch prereqs.
- **P6 — Expansion + ship.** Author gap-fill configs (Nertea/Orion/probes); finalize mod set
  ("RP-1 Express minus RP-1" baseline); the two test workflows (add-a-part-mod loop;
  clean+recommended install test); RAM-trim submod; packaging. **Prove:** clean-room install runs.

## Tasks

### T1 — Lock a good canonical part list BEFORE building the tree ⬅ blocks all tree work (= P0)
The tree must be designed and balanced around a known, fixed part set. Do **not** start node
layout until the part list is settled.
- Diff RO-clean vs RP-1-clean → what RP-1 adds vs what it blacklists/hides. *(Groundwork parked at
  `scratchpad/part_diff.py`. Caveat found: the two clean installs have **different mod sets** —
  control for that. Both are ~100% RO-curated, so non-RO only appears once mods are added.)*
- Decide the canonical set = shared RO-curated core + chosen RO-but-not-RP-1 parts + authored gap-fills.
- Produce the **manifest** + a "what's new / unplaced / non-RO" diff workflow for testing added part mods.
- **Prove:** a committed manifest; every part RO-supported or has an authored config; count vs the
  ~200-node "home everything" target.

## Reference instances (outside the repo — never nuke)
- `../ksp_instance_clean` — pristine rebuild base; copy it to spin up a fresh test instance.
- `../ksp_rp1_clean`, `../ksp_ro_clean` (+ `_expanded`) — clean RP-1 / RO references (used for the part diff).
- Other `../ksp_*` folders hold various mod combos. **Some may be in a messed-up state — validate the
  actual installed mods (`ls GameData` / `CKAN/registry.json`) before trusting any non-`*_clean` folder.**

## Parked ideas (later threads)
- **Relocatable / selectable KSC** — let the player choose or move the launch site ("united
  Kerbalkind → launch from anywhere"), where it's valid gameplay. Mechanically grounded:
  `KerbalKonstructs` + RSS launch sites (already in the RO_clean loadout); RP-1 has a launch-site
  system to study and strip of its career coupling.
